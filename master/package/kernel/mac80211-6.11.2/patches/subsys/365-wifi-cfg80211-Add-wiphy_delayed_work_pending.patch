Subject: [PATCH] wifi: cfg80211: Add wiphy_delayed_work_pending()

Add wiphy_delayed_work_pending() to check if any delayed work timer is
pending, that can be used to be sure that wiphy_delayed_work_queue()
won't postpone an already pending delayed work.

+ * How wiphy_delayed_work_queue() works is by setting a timer which
+ * when it expires calls wiphy_work_queue() to queue the wiphy work.
+ * Because wiphy_delayed_work_queue() uses mod_timer(), if it is
+ * called twice and the second call happens before the first call
+ * deadline, the work will rescheduled for the second deadline and
+ * won't run before that.
+ *
+ * wiphy_delayed_work_pending() can be used to detect if calling
+ * wiphy_work_delayed_work_queue() would start a new work schedule
+ * or delayed a previous one. As seen below it cannot be used to
+ * detect precisely if the work has finished to execute nor if it
+ * is currently executing.
