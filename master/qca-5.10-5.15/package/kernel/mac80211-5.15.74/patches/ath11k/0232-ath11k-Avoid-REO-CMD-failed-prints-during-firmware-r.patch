Subject: [PATCH 232/241] ath11k: Avoid REO CMD failed prints during firmware
 recovery

Currently when firmware recovery is in progress, we do not queue REO
commands to the firmware, instead -ESHUTDOWN will be returned to the
caller leading to a failure print on the console. The REO command in
the problem scenario is sent for all tids of a peer in which case we
will have 16 failure prints on the console for a single peer. For an
AP usecase, this count would be even higher in a worst case scenario.
Since these commands are bound to fail during firmware recovery, it
is better to avoid printing these failures and thereby avoid message
flooding on the console.

Tested-on: WCN6750 hw1.0 AHB WLAN.MSL.1.0.1-00887-QCAMSLSWPLZ-1
