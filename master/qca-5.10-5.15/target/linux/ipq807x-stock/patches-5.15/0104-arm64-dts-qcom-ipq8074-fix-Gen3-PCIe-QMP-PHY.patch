Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: fix Gen3 PCIe QMP PHY

IPQ8074 comes in 2 silicon versions:
* v1 with 2x Gen2 PCIe ports and QMP PHY-s
* v2 with 1x Gen3 and 1x Gen2 PCIe ports and QMP PHY-s

v2 is the final and production version that is actually supported by the
kernel, however it looks like PCIe related nodes were added for the v1 SoC.

Now that we have Gen3 QMP PHY support, we can start fixing the PCIe support
by fixing the Gen3 QMP PHY node first.

Change the compatible to the Gen3 QMP PHY, correct the register space start
and size, add the missing misc PCS register space.
