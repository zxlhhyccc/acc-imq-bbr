Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: disable TRIM on Kingston EMMC04G-M627

It seems that Kingston EMMC04G-M627 despite advertising TRIM support does
not work when the core is trying to use REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES.

We are seeing I/O errors in OpenWrt under 6.1 on Zyxel NBG7815 that we did
not previously have and tracked it down to REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES.

Trying to use fstrim seems to also throw errors like:
[93010.835112] I/O error, dev loop0, sector 16902 op 0x3:(DISCARD) flags 0x800 phys_seg 1 prio class 2

Disabling TRIM makes the error go away, so lets add a quirk for this eMMC
to disable TRIM.
