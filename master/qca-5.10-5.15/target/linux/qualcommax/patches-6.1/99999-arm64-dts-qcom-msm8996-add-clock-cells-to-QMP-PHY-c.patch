Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Add '#clock-cells' to QMP PHY
 child node

'#clock-cells' is a required property of QMP PHY child node, not itself.
Move it to fix the dtbs_check warnings.

There are only '#clock-cells' removal from SM8350 QMP PHY nodes, because
child nodes already have the property.
